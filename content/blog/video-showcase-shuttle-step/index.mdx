## Details

The shuttle item is a very individual APEX element.
It serves a similar purpose as a checkbox group or a multi-select list as it allows the users to choose multiple values.

To make testing the component easier, we created a step that allows interaction with the shuttle item conveniently.

We provide a list of shuttle items on the given page so that you can conveniently select the right one. After that, you can decide in which direction you want to move the values. You can either move all or provide a list of values.
