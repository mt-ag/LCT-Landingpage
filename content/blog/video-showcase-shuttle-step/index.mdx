## Details

The shuttle item is a very unique APEX element.
It serves a similar purpose as a checkbox group or a multi-select list as it allows the users to choose multiple values.

To make testing the component easier, we created a step that allows interaction with the shuttle item in a convenient way.

Instead of manually providing a selector you can conveniently select the shuttle item you want to interact with from a list. After that, you can decide in which direction you want to move the values. You can either move all or provide a list of values.
